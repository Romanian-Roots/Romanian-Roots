# Project Name: Capsula Culturala

## Description

A cultural platform that encourages people across Romania to explore, share, and preserve local traditions by hiding and finding "cultural capsules." Built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. Hosted on Railway.

### Problem

Romania's rich cultural heritage is often overlooked by both locals and tourists who stick to mainstream attractions. Many traditional stories, local customs, and hidden cultural gems remain unknown outside their immediate communities. Young people are increasingly disconnected from their cultural roots, and there's a lack of engaging platforms that make exploring Romanian culture interactive and adventurous.

### Solution

Capsula Culturală creates an innovative treasure hunt experience that combines digital technology with real-world exploration. We hide physical "cultural capsules" throughout Romania containing travel journals, symbolic objects, and QR codes linking to our online platform. Users can discover new locations, share stories, exchange cultural artifacts, and contribute to a growing community of cultural explorers. This gamified approach makes Romanian heritage discovery exciting and accessible for all ages, fostering deeper connections between people, places, and traditions.
